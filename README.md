# iTunes AppleScripts

iTunes AppleScripts is a collection of AppleScripts that control iTunes in
various ways (e.g. play, next track, go to current track, etc.). I bind them
to shortcut keys (see Usage below).

## Installation

Install the scripts by typing `rake install` in this directory. This will
compile the AppleScripts into .scpt files and copy them into your
~/Library/Scripts/iTunes folder.

## Usage

It is recommended that you bind the scripts to shortcut keys in the system. I
bind the scripts using the
[FastScripts](http://www.red-sweater.com/fastscripts/) application. One could
also use [Quicksilver](http://github.com/tiennou/blacktree-alchemy) triggers.

  myself.
